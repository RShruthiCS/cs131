# datacollector.sh

## üìå What this command does

This script automates the process of downloading, extracting, and analyzing tabular datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (or similar sources). It supports both `.zip` and `.csv` files. The tool generates a `summary.md` file for each selected CSV containing:

- A list of all features (columns) with index numbers
- Minimum, Maximum, Mean, and Standard Deviation for selected numerical columns
